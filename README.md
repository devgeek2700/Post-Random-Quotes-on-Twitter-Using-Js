# Post Random Quotes on Twitter Using Js
In this project, I have made a basic random quote generator, and after generating quotes, users can post them on their Twitter accounts.

This is a simple project made using API and HTML, CSS, and JS. In this project, we will first fetch quotes through the API and then display them in the text area. After clicking on the button, new quotes will be generated, and after selecting the quote, the user can post it on their Twitter account by clicking on the Twitter logo.
